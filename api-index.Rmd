This website provides access to the R system dependency databases that are available from [`rstudio/r-system-requirements`](https://github.com/rstudio/r-system-requirements). 

Contents: 

- [`patterns`](patterns.json) is used as a lookup table for identify system dependencies
- [`systems`](systems.json) provides a list of available operating systems (limited to linux distributions)
- [`/rules`](rules/index.html) is a directory containing the lookup rules for each system dependencies requirements e.g. `rules/gdal.json`
- [`/pkgs`](pkgs/index.html) is a directory containing json files for each package listing their name, version, and system dependencies e.g. `pkgs/igraph.json`
